# Transforming Enterprise Search with AI Using Snowflake Cortex Search

As organizations increasingly adopt generative AI technologies, streamlining and securing AI workflows becomes essential. Snowflake Cortex Search offers a powerful, AI-driven solution for exploring vast amounts of structured and unstructured data directly within the Snowflake environment. To demonstrate how Cortex Search can transform search capabilities with AI, I used a simple library books search system with unstructured data as an example, while highlighting its broader advantages for enterprises seeking to harness AI with strong data governance.
At its core, Cortex Search utilizes vector search, powered by Snowflake's high-performance and cost-effective Arctic Embed M model. 
<br><br>This vector search is enhanced with a hybrid approach that combines lexical search and semantic reranking to optimize retrieval and ranking of results. 
This ensemble method leverages:
<br>
### Vector search for semantic similarity
Unlike conventional methods that rely on the exact match of keywords within documents, vector search understands the semantic meaning of queries, retrieving results based on the concepts behind the words.
### Keyword search for lexical matching
Keyword search focuses on exact word matches, ensuring that specific terms from the query appear in the results. This method is particularly useful for retrieving documents with precise language or terminology.
### Semantic reranking to surface the most relevant results
Once the initial results are retrieved, semantic reranking reorders them based on their relevance to the query's intent. This ensures that the most contextually appropriate results appear at the top of the list.
<br>
By using this multi-pronged strategy, Cortex Search can handle a wide variety of queries effectively without extensive tuning.
